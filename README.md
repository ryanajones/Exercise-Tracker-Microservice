# Exercise Tracker Microservice

Create a new user and use the returned JSON userID number to add exercise logs. Examples on the UI show how to use the address bar's query string parameters to retrieve exercise log information. NodeJS and ExpressJS are used to create a RESTful API to handle front-end HTTP method requests. MongooseJS communicates with MongoDB to create and read exercise information in the database.

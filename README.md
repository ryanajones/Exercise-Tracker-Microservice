# Exercise Tracker Microservice

Create a new user by submitting a username. In return, a JSON response containing an ID to save for adding an exercise entry will be displayed to the screen.

Add an exercise entry by passing the given user ID into the userId form field. Add a description, duration, and an optional date for the exercise. Pressing the submit button will submit it to the database and return a JSON response of the information entered.

Next step is to receive information from the database about the desired exercise logs by typing query string parameters into the URL. Directions and examples on how to do that is on the user interface.
